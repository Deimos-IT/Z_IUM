# CURRENT IDEAS
- [ ] *MultiPlatform Application* **Ma To Do List**
- [ ] [smart glasses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9bnmES7O74)[^1] that shows **path based** on your preference
	- **best** path: *shortest* google.maps
	- **easy** path: *least nÂ°/heigth of bridges* or that has ramps
	- **safe** path: *uses most accessible ways* to ensure a quicker rescue, most populated
		- v2 **accessible** path: *ramp guaranteed path* for people in wheelchairss
[^1]: i think... **xiaomi smart glasses** is a concept too advanced and **complicated** for the elderly, our target is **not** to **replace** the **smartphone**.
# Need Idea For:
- [ ] **ambient display**
	- [ ] carries a message or information
	- it **relates** to the **environment**  
	it may seem like a piece of furniture  
	- discrete interface flexible approach,  
	which does **NOT require immediate access**
	- **indirect touch** preferable, 
		- detection of **gestures**, attention to the ambiguity of signs between various cultures
		- **eye detection**, *which might connect to smart glasse*?
# Development Targets
- [ ] **simplified widgets**, with fixed position and fewer choices
- [ ] **reduction of the number of screens**
# Secondary Targets
- [ ] phone & tablet diversity **size**
- [ ] _**sustainability**_ towards the elderly  
but at the same time also using their resources,  
to make a contribution to the rest of the citizens.  
- [ ] being **glasses** it could be useful to **integrate** a **solution** also for **vision problems**
# Idee
1. Xiaomi smart glasses have a flat and fixed screen, meaning that it does not have a depth detector.
Additional public panels could be added such as the room of the professor of the [last lesson](https://photos.app.goo.gl/DZM6P1aWQqMF76Sm8) :recycle:, those could be ambient displays that give different information about the
- [ ] sustainability/friendly envinronmental thougths
- [ ] turism/story telling
- [ ] flooding
and they could be **interactable**[LIKE those of prof](https://photos.app.goo.gl/m7AFzybMAs9T7Rvr9), if not the same :recycle:
	- note: recycling is very sustainable, we need to recycle too :recycle:
